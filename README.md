# üöÄ VentureLens : A clear lens into Feasibility and Market reality

An AI-powered Startup Feasibility Checker service that evaluates startup ideas using a **multi-agent architecture**. The system works like a "virtual team": a **Planner agent** breaks down the analysis, and multiple specialized agents (Market Analyst, Competitor Scout, SWOT Analyst, and Financial Modeler) run in parallel to produce structured results. A **Synthesizer agent** then merges everything into a concise feasibility report with a GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO verdict.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Multi-agent architecture** built with LangGraph  
- **Parallel execution** of market, competitor, SWOT, and finance agents  
- **Structured JSON outputs** with Pydantic validation  
- **Up-to-date data fetching** via tools (web search, finance APIs, trends)  
- **Transparent results** ‚Äì citations for market and competitor data  
- **Feasibility scoring** with weighted criteria (market, finance, competition, risks)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent Workflow

1. **Planner Agent**: Receives startup idea and creates structured analysis plan
2. **Parallel Execution**: Four specialized agents run concurrently:
   - **Market Analyst**: TAM, growth, trends analysis
   - **Competitor Scout**: Direct/indirect competitor research  
   - **SWOT Analyst**: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
   - **Financial Modeler**: Budget, runway, revenue projections
3. **Synthesizer Agent**: Combines outputs into final feasibility verdict
